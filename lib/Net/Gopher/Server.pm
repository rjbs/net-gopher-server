=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Gopher::Server -setup;
  __PACKAGE__->run;

That's it!  You might need to run with privs, since by default it will bind to
port 70.

You can also:

  use Net::Gopher::Server -setup => { port => 1170 };
  __PACKAGE__->run;

...if you want.

Actually, both of these are sort of moot unless you also provide an C<isa>
argument, which sets the base class for the created server.
Net::Gopher::Server is, for now, written to work as a Net::Server subclass.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

How can there be no F<Gopher> server on the CPAN in 2008?  Probably because
there wasn't one in 1996, and by then it was already too late.  (Was there even
a CPAN?  Barely.)  Gopher might be dead, but it's fun for playing around.

Right now Net::Gopher::Server uses L<Net::Server>, but that might not last.
Stick to the documented interface.

Speaking of the documented interface, you'll almost certainly want to subclass
Net::Gopher::Server to make it do something useful.
